# LPEM
Locality Preservation for Unsupervised Multimodal Change Detection. 

## Introduction

LPEM is an energy based model for unsupervised multimodal change detection. LPEM constructs the links between relationships (same/different) and labels (changed/unchanged) of pairwise superpixels, which are domain-invariant. LPEM consists of three types of constrains: the structure consistency based on feature similarity, the label consistency based on spatial continuity, and the sparse penalty based on a change priori. LPEM is a new paradigm that outputs the change map directly without the need to generate intermediate difference image as other algorithms have done.

Please refer to the paper for details. You are more than welcome to use the code!
